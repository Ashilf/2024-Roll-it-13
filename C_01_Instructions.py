---------------------------------- Instructions ---------------------------------
   
  To begin, decide on a score goal (eg: the first one to get a score of 50 Wins!)
  
  
  for each round of the game, you win points by rolling dice 
  The winner of the end of the round is the one who gets 13 (or slightly less)
  
  
  If you win the round, then your score will increase by the number of points 
  that you earn.
  If your first roll of two dice is a double (eg: both dice show a three), 
  then your score will be DOUBLE the number of points.
  
  
  If you lose the round, then you don't get any points.
  
  If you and the computer tie (eg: you both get a score of 11), then you
   will have 11 points added to your score.
